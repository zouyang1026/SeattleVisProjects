# Gray Anatomy in 2024: Deciphering Seattle's Colorful Canopy

## Project Overview

"Gray Anatomy in 2024" aims to explore and present the true colors of Seattle's skies, particularly the variance over time. Our group's focus was to challenge the stereotype of Seattle's monochromatic gray skies by analyzing the colors over a week in February from a consistent location - the University of Washington Quadrangle (UW Quad).

## Learning Objectives

- Develop a methodical approach for data creation, collection, and analysis that reveals the complex, context-rich spatial experiences of Seattle.
- Utilize Python to create informative bar graphs.
- Understand the storytelling potential of data through visual forms.
- Develop and refine strategies for encoding and visualizing spatial data to convey underlying stories.
- Enhance our ability to narrate and interpret the spatial data through various forms of visual representation.
- Critically evaluate the encoding and visualization processes, and develop or identify alternatives for improvement.

## Methodology

Over seven days, team members Zhanpeng Ouyang, Katherine Poch, Rino Hamanishi, and Vanessa Sakdy captured images of the sky at different times, resulting in thirty snapshots. These images were analyzed to extract color data, which were then used to create a comprehensive visual representation of Seattle's skies.

### Colab Notebook

Our data collection and image processing methods are documented in our Colab notebook:

### Google Drive Folder

The folder containing all original and processed images can be found here:

## Final Visualization

Our findings have been encapsulated in a stacked bar chart, revealing the varied colors of Seattle's skies during an ordinary February week.

## Reflections and Essay

The accompanying essay "Seattle's Skies Decoded: A February Color Analysis" provides a narrative for our project, discussing our methodology, findings, and reflections on the data. The essay underscores our analytical process and offers insights into the often-unseen colors that adorn Seattle's winter skies.
