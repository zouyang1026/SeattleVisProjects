# SeattleVisProjects

Welcome to SeattleVisProjects, a comprehensive repository showcasing a series of data visualization projects focused on exploring the spatial and emotional landscape of Seattle, Washington. Each project within this repository represents a unique exploration into different aspects of Seattle's environment, from its ever-changing skies to the hidden happy places within the city's urban fabric.

## Projects Overview

This repository is divided into four main projects, each with a distinct focus:

1. **Seattle Flows** - Analyzing the movement within the city to uncover patterns and narratives hidden within the hustle and bustle of daily life.
2. **Color of Seattle** - A visual journey through the colors that define Seattle's cityscape, from its natural beauty to its urban charm.
3. **Grey Anatomy in 2024** - Investigating the true colors of Seattle's skies, challenging the stereotype of Seattle's gray weather.
4. **Happy Places** - Discovering the spaces within Seattle that spark joy and happiness, told through personal narratives and visualized through data.

Each project is documented in its dedicated folder, complete with data, code notebooks, visualizations, and a detailed `README.md` providing insights into the objectives, methodology, and findings.
