# Welcome to Seattle - Flight Data Visualization

## Project Overview

"Welcome to Seattle" is the inaugural project in the SeattleVisProjects series, designed to analyze and visualize spatial data capturing the essence of human experiences within and around Seattle, WA. This project provides a visualization of the flow of domestic flights into Seattle over the span of one month, highlighting Seattle's connectivity with other major US cities.

## Learning Objectives

- Develop a systematic approach to data creation, collection, and structuring.
- Learn to create and interpret Sankey diagrams in Python to represent data flows.
- Visualize complex, context-rich human spatial experiences.
- Enhance narrative skills in spatial data presentation through diverse visualization forms.
- Cultivate interpretive and analytical writing skills focused on context-rich visualizations.
- Critically evaluate encoding and visualization processes, considering alternatives and developing custom methods.

## Data Source

The data for this visualization comes from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, detailing the volume and points of origin for flights arriving in Seattle.

## Infographic

The project's infographic is a Sankey diagram that illustrates the volume of incoming flights to Seattle from various cities across the nation. The diagram's line thickness indicates the number of flights, providing a visual representation of travel frequencies to Seattle.
