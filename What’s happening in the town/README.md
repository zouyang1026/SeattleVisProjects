# What’s Happening in the Town - Capitol Hill’s Social Tapestry

## Project Overview

In the second endeavor of the SeattleVisProjects series, "What’s Happening in the Town" dives into the social dynamics of Seattle's Capitol Hill. This project seeks to visualize the activities, enjoyments, thoughts, and shared experiences of the people in Capitol Hill by employing a web crawler to collect data from Yelp and visualizing it through a Radial Dendrogram.

## Learning Objectives

- Craft a systematic process for data creation, collection, and structuring to capture the nuanced human experiences of Capitol Hill.
- Utilize a web crawler in Python to gather data.
- Visualize the collected data with a Radial Dendrogram, emphasizing the community's activities and sentiments.
- Understand the underlying context of data to effectively communicate it visually.
- Enhance narrative ability to describe spatial data through diverse visualization forms.
- Develop analytical writing skills to interpret and discuss the meaning behind rich visualizations.
- Critically evaluate the process of encoding and visualization to identify or develop alternative methods.

## Data Collection and Visualization

The data was collected using a custom Python script that scraped Yelp reviews, focusing on the top-rated bars in the Capitol Hill area. The visualization highlights the common themes found within the reviews, revealing patterns and insights into what people appreciate and experience in these social hubs.

## Reflections

The visualization project was an exploration into the changing identity of Capitol Hill, known for its rich LGBTQ+ history and vibrant nightlife. The Radial Dendrogram provides a visual narrative that reveals the community's struggle and resilience in the face of gentrification, serving as both a reflection and a reminder of the importance of these social spaces.
