# Happy Places - Circle Packing Infographic

## Project Overview

"Happy Places" is an exploratory data visualization project capturing the emotional landscape of Seattle. This project is centered around the concept of spatial emotions, specifically the joy and positivity associated with various locations within the city.

## Learning Objectives

- To develop a process for data creation, collection, and curation that encapsulates complex human spatial experiences.
- To learn the technical skills required to create a Circle Packing diagram in Python.
- To understand how to communicate the context of spatial data visually.
- To narrate spatial data through different forms of visualization and written descriptions.
- To critically assess the encoding and visualization process and explore alternative methods.

## Project Workflow

This project followed a systematic workflow that included:

1. Developing the context and creating a fictional character that embodies the emotional connection to Seattle.
2. Preparing the data through a series of photos and narratives.
3. Finding and applying methods to visualize the collected data.
4. Visualizing the data using a Circle Packing diagram.
5. Narrating and reflecting on the data to capture the essence of happiness in various Seattle locations.

## Data Collection and Visualization

Data for this project was generated through an interactive process where a balloon, representing a cheerful character named Mars, was photographed at different happy locations. These locations were then plotted on a map using Padlet, where stories about why these places are considered 'happy' were shared.

## Essay Overview

The accompanying essay, "Mars in the Kitchen," tells the story of a fictional character's emotional journey in Seattle, highlighting how everyday spaces can become repositories of happiness.

## Acknowledgements

This project would not have been possible without the participation and contributions of individuals who shared their happy place stories on the Padlet map.

## Future Work

The project has set a foundation for understanding the spatial distribution of emotions in Seattle. Future enhancements will involve a more extensive dataset and potentially the integration of time-lapse photography to capture the evolving emotional landscape of the city.
