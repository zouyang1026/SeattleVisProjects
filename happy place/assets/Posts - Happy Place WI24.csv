Baloona would recommend going to an RSO at least once in your time here at UW, because the people in them are friendly and open to making new connections. Also they have comfortable furniture and big study tables in the ECC!

I used to go to PACCAR Hall all the time during my first year at UW! Even though I don't go quite often now, this building always has a place in my heart. From a study place to a small dining area, PACCAR has all I need as a student.

This is the best place to go to on a sunny day because of the all-glass architecture, and you will get to see other Huskies come and go and also get to see the beautiful blue from the sky above and the calming green from the ground or the tree.
